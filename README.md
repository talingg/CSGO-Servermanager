# CSGO-Servermanager
This is a simple GUI to manage a running CSGO Server via RCON. I created this program to allow participants of a LAN party to organize themselves without having knowledge of the CS:GO ingame console or the RCON protocol. It is primarily designed for the administration of a Wingman server (map selection). The other options work independently of the game mode.

## Usage
Under Windows the Jar file can be called with the following command (for example with a Bat file):
```java
@echo off
start javaw -jar CSGO-GUI-1.0-SNAPSHOTq.jar
exit
```
